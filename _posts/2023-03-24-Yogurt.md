# Yogurt

## Step 1 - Heating
Heat milk in stainless steel container to 185 F (use a food thermometer)
Instant pot does the same and stops overheating.
I do not want to occupy my instant pot so I use the same vessel to be able to estimate the time it will take to heat chilled milk to 185F.

If you like thicker yogurt, let milk boil (212F) to lose more water.
But you should be stirring constantly to avoid overflow

## Step 2 - Cooldown
Let milk cool down to 115 F in the vessel.

## Step 3 - Fermentation
You may pour into several containers from a bigger vessel.
Add starter yogurt with cultures. (the more you add the faster fermentation will be)
Record the amount to adjust next time.
Place the vessel(s) in oven with light on for faster fermatation or on the counter

My recipe:
Vessel size: to 185F (45 minutes to heat)
Cooldown : 2 hours to 115F
Starter yogurt voume : 3 tsp
Length in oven - 100 minutes in oven with light on
